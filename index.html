          research of College of Management Mahidol University, they published
          the top ten of the laziest activities of Thai people which housework
          is the top three of the research. So, we see the opportunity in the
          business gaps of the lazy marketing or lazy consumer which would be a
          trend in nowadays. Since the behavior of Thai people that like comfort
          and turn to rely more on the technology. Also, the laundry is the one
          of the housework that need to responsible. Moreover, laundry has a

          quality of service.
